 # DocFormats Document Object Model (DOM)

 This file defines data structures and functions for manipulating parsed XML data, represented in
 memory as a tree. It is inspired by the Document Object Model (DOM) API commonly used for
 processing XML data, but does not follow the API strictly.

 The two primary classes are DFDocument and DFNode. A DFDocument represents a parsed XML or HTML
 document, and acts as a container for all of the nodes within the document. A DFNode object
 represents either an element (represented textually as `<element-name> ... </element-name>`) or a
 text node (containing literal text from the XML document, residing inside an element).

 Every DFDocument object has a root note, and every DFNode object has a doubly-linked list of
 children. You can traverse the tree of nodes by using the first and next fields defined in the
 DFNode struct, and determine the element or node type via the \ref tag field, and the textual
 content (for text nodes) via the \value object.

 ## Tags

 Naming of XML elements and attributes is considerably complicated by the use of namespaces.
 Conceptually, every element is identified by a (namespcae URI, local name) pair, which determines
 its semantic meaning. However, these pairs are not directly specified in source files, as namespace
 URIs can be quite long. Instead, the XML Namespace specification [1] specifies a mechanism to map
 *prefixes* to namespace URIs, and elements in the textual representation are named based on a
 (prefix, local name) combination. With this mechanism, a program reading an XML document must first
 look up the prefix mapping to determine the namespace URI, before it can correctly identify an
 element. Worse, the mapping between prefixes and namespace URI can differ between different parts
 of the document.

 DocFormats uses an in-memory representation of XML elements in which the name is replaced by a
 numeric *tag*. Each possible tag corresponds to a (namespace URI, local name) pair, which
 simplifies checking the types of elements to a simple integer comparison, rather than a complicated
 symbol resolution algorithm. Furthermore, these tags can optionally be declared as pre-defined
 constants, as in \ref XMLNames.h, enabling them to be used in switch statements --- which improves
 performance of code that has to check for many different element types.

 Each document has a \ref DFNameMap object which stores the information necessary to map between
 numeric tags and (namespace URI, local name) pairs, and also stores the default prefix to be used
 for ecah namespace URI. During parsing, as carried out DFParseXMLFile() and DFParseXMLString(),
 symbol resolution based on the textual names given in the source file is performed, resulting in
 the tags in the constructed tree corresponding to either pre-defined tags in the default name map,
 or other tags whose numeric values have been dynamically allocated during parsing. During
 serialisation, namespace mappings based on the default prefix for each namespace URI are set on the
 root element of the output file, and tags are translated into (prefix:local name) combinations for
 the actual start and end tags of elements.

 ## Memory allocation

 DFDocument objects are reference-counted, but the memory occupied by all DFNode objects is managed
 by their containing documents. As you create new nodes, the document itself takes care of
 allocating memory for them, and also keeping track of all the nodes it has allocated. When a
 document is freed --- that is, when its reference count drops to zero --- all nodes allocated by
 that document are also freed.

 This approach is for performance reasons. In an earlier version of the library, each DFNode object
 was allocated separately, as a reference-counted Objective C object. This implied large overheads
 both for incrementing and decrementing the reference count, and for traversing through the node
 tree releasing all the references individually. The approach used now, implemented by DFAllocator,
 makes only a few calls to `malloc` to allocate large chunks of memory, and then allocates portions
 of those memory blocks itself for the DFNode objects. When a DFDocument object is freed, those
 blocks are simply released in one go, without the need to individually inspect each node to check
 its reference count. The same memory blocks are used to allocate strings for attribute values,
 which also get freed along with the document.

 THe previous paragraph describes an implementation detail which you don't need to worry about
 when using documents. Just call DFDocumentNew() or DFDocumentNewWithRoot() to create a document,
 and DFDocumentRelease() when you are finished with it. All memory that has been allocated for
 nodes, attribute values, and text node values will automatically be freed when the document's
 reference count drops to zero, as it would after a simple new/release sequence.
