/** \file

 A CSSSheet object represents a CSS stylesheet. It contains a series of styles, identified by
 their selector (element and optional class name), each of which is corresponds to a CSSStyle
 object.

 CSSSheet uses reference counting. When you create a new object using CSSSheetNew, it initially
 has a reference count of 1. You can increment and decrement the reference count by calling
 CSSSheetRetain and CSSSheetRelease, respectively. When the reference count drops to 0, the object
 will be freed from memory.

 Each style is identified by its **base selector**, or simply **selector** for short. This
 corresponds to the initial part of the selector used in all rules of a CSS stylesheet that are
 associated with that style. The selector consists of an element name (e.g. `h1`), plus an optional
 class name (e.g. `h1.class`).

 To add a new style or retrieve an existing style from the stylesheet, use @ref
 CSSSheetLookupSelector or @ref CSSSheetLookupElement. Both of these functions take an `add`
 parameter, which indicate whether the style should be added if it does not already exist. If you
 just want to get an existing file, pass in zero for the add parameter. If you want to add the style
 if it does not already exist, pass in a non-zero value. @ref CSSSheetLookupSelector takes a
 selector (element name and optional class name combined into a single string) as a parameter; @ref
 CSSSheetLookupElement takes the element name and class name as separate parameters.

/**
 Creates a new CSSStyle object whose rules are all "flattened" --- that is, they include all properties
 defined on the style and all of its ancestors.

 Formats like Word and ODF support **style inheritance**, whereby each style can optionally have a
 parent style associated with it. This causes the style to inherit all properties from its parent,
 in the same way that a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass in an object-oriented
 programming language. The parent may itself have a parent, and so forth, so there may be any number
 of "ancestors" of the style.

 The process of flattening a style involves starting with a style itself, collecting all properties
 directly defined there, and then repeatedly going through the chain of ancestors adding all properties
 they define as well. The result is that the flattened style contains all inherited properties.

 For example, suppose you had the following three styles defined:

     p.One {
         font-weight: bold;
         font-size: 12pt;
     }

     p.Two {
         -uxwrite-parent: "p.One";
         color: red;
         font-size: 14pt;
     }

     p.Three {
         -uxwrite-parent: "p.Two";
         font-size: 18pt;
         font-style: italic;
     }

 The collapsed style would have the following properties (note that font-size is overridden, so
 we use the definition closest to the original style in preference to the value defined by its
 ancestors):

     p.Three {
         -uxwrite-parent: "p.Two";
         font-weight: bold;        // From p.One
         color: red;               // From p.Two
         font-size: 18pt;          // From p.Three (overriden)
         font-style: italic;       // From p.Three
     }

 The fact that the properties have been flattened like this mean they will display as expected
 in a web browser (and UX Write itself, since it displays documents in the same way as a web
 browser). Without flattening, we would only have the `font-size` and `font-weight` properties
 defined; browsers don't know about the special `-uxwrite-parent` property and cannot infer that
 the style is inherited.

 Unlike all other CSSSheet methods, the CSSStyle object returned by this function is newly
 allocated, and the caller must call CSSStyleRelease on the object when finished with it.

 Builds a hash table of rules to be included in the textual representation of the stylesheet. This
 corresponds directly to what is produced by CSSSheetFlattenedStyle(), but is in the form of a hash
 table rather than a string, so that it can be easily manipulated in code.

 Each key in the hash table is a full selector (i.e. base selector + suffix). Each value is another
 hash table, whose keys are property names and whose values are property names.

 The only reason this function is exposed separately from CSSSheetFlattenedStyle() is that UX Write
 needs to pass this information to the javascript portion of the editing code, which uses it for
 things like determining the style to apply to new paragraphs. In general you would normally just
 call CSSSheetFlattenedStyle() instead.

 The returned hash table is newly allocated and must be released by the caller.

     CSSSheet *sheet = CSSSheetNew();
