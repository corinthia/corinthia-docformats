 There are two types of tests: plain tests and data tests. The former are entirely self-contained;
 they consist of a C function that takes no input and produces no output; simply calling functions
 like utassert(), utexpect(), and utfail() to trigger success or failure. These are intended for
 testing functionality that requires no or only trivial amounts of input data.
 
 Data tests are for functions which need to be called multiple times with different input values,
 read from files. The input data comes from the *.test files included in the various modules, the
 first line of each indicating the name of the test function that should be called, as well as
 optional parameters. A data test retrieves these parameters and/or input data, and acts upon it.
 Typically, part of the input data for the test will include the expected output of the test, which
 can be checked by calling utexpect().
 
 The tests are triggered by the dftest function, which can be run in three modes:
 
 dftest plain
 dftest data <path>
 dftest all <path>
 
 When run in 'plain' mode, only the plain tests requiring no input files are executed. When run in
 'data' mode, the specified path will be searched for all files with the extension .test, and the
 functions indicated in the first line of those files will be called. A given function may be called
 multiple times, since each test file corresponds to one test execution. The 'all' mode does both
 plain and data tests.
 
 All test groups defined in the various source files in test/ directories must be explicitly
 referenced from main.c in dftest, as this is where it gets the references to the set of available
 groups. These are passed to utrun, so it can determine what tests it needs to execute based on
 the plain and data parameters.
