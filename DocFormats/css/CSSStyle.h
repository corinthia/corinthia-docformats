 # %CSSStyle

 A CSSStyle object represents a set of rules in a CSS stylesheet which all have a common **base
 selector**, consisting of an element name and optional class name (e.g. `h1` or `h1.Appendix`). The
 base selector is used to identify the style in a CSSSheet object, and is passed to
 CSSSheetLookupSelector() to add or retrieve a particular style.

 Each CSSStyle object has one or more **rules** associated with it. A rule is identified by its
 **suffix**, which is the text that comes immediately after the base selector in the textual
 representation of the stylesheet. For example, a rule defined in a CSS stylesheet with a selector
 of `h1.Appendix::before` would have a base selector of `h1.Appendix`, and a suffix of `::before`.

 In the typical case, a style will have only a single rule with an empty suffix, and this rule will
 define all of the properties of that style. For example, a style with a base selector of `p.Warning`
 and properties defining the color and font size would appear in the textual representation of the
 stylesheet like this:

     p.Warning {
         color: red;
         font-size: 18pt;
     }

 In other cases, a style may have multiple rules, each with a different suffix. Each rule defines
 the properties to be applied to a certain aspect of that element, such as particular rows of a
 table. For example, style with a base selector of `table.Statistics` which defines a black border,
 and colors odd rows blue and odd rows red, would have three separate rules:

     table.Statistics {
         border: 1px solid black;
     }

     table.Statistics > * > tr:nth-of-type(odd) > td {
         color: blue;
     }

     table.Statistics > * > tr:nth-of-type(even) > td {
         color: red;
     }

 ## Creating styles

 You should not create CSSStyle objects directly --- instead, call CSSSheetLookupSelector() with
 the `add` parameter set to 1. This ensures that if there is already a style with that selector
 present in the stylesheet, you will not end up with a duplicate. CSSSheetLookupSelector() returns
 the new or existing style, and calls CSSStyleNew() internally if necessary.

 All though CSSStyle objects are reference-counted, you generally do not need to retain or release
 them yourself, as the CSSSheet object itself maintains a reference to all styles within it. When
 a CSSSheet object is freed, it releases all references to the styles it contains, so assuming there
 are no additional references to them, they will be freed at that time as well.

 ## Working with rules

 A rule is represented by a CSSProperties object. The main function for accessing rules is
 CSSStyleRuleForSuffix(), which requires the desired suffix to be specified. There are also several
 short-hand funcitons for obtaining certain commonly-used rules; CSSStyleRule() returns the default
 rule (the one with an empty suffix), while CSSStyleCell() and CSSStyleBefore() returns the rules
 for table cells and content displayed before an element, respectively.

 When you call any of these functions and the rule does not exist, it is created. When the
 stylesheet is converted to its textual representation using CSSSheetCopyCSSText(), empty rules
 (those with no properties) are excluded --- so it is never necessary to remove a rule as such.
 You can, however, clear all the properties on it, which will have the same effect.

 ## Style inheritance

 To support working with documents in formats like docx and ODF, which support style inheritance, we
 use the special `-uxwrite-parent` CSS property to record the base selector of the parent style, if
 any. This should not be set directly, however, as some characters in the style name may not be
 valid in CSS values. Instead, the parent value is stored as a quoted string, according to the
 escaping rules defined in the CSS specification. You should always use CSSStyleCopyParent() and
 CSSStyleSetParent() to access this property; as this handles quoting for you.

 Note that since CSSStyle objects do not contain direct references to each other or the stylesheet
 in which they are contained, if you want to obtain the actual CSSStyle object representing the
 parent style, you need to do so from the CSSSheet object. This can be done using
 CSSSheetParentOfStyle().

 ## Style for next paragraph

 Microsoft Word and OpenOffice both allow a style to specify which style should be used for the next
 paragraph, if the user presses enter within a paragraph of the given style. For example, it is
 typical for heading styles to specify "Normal" as the next style, so when a user types in a heading
 and presses enter, the program adds a normal paragraph, instead of another heading.

 As with parent styles, we use a special property to record this, `-uxwrite-next`. The UX Write
 editing code knows about this property, and uses it to determine what style to associate with
 newly-created paragraphs after enter is pressed. As with the `-uxwrite-parent` property, this
 needs to be quoted, and you should always use CSSStyleCopyNext() and CSSStyleSetNext() to access it.
