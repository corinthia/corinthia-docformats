# This script generates a directory tree html representation of the
# Corinthia project for the local file directory and the remote Github
# directory (master).
#
# It pulls down latest Corinthia version, makes the new tree, diffs it
# to the old tree and if the tree has changed, creates, commit and
# pushes the new trees.  It uses the commit message to label the
# file's purpose.
#
# File created/updated:  
#
#    $TREE_FILE_NAME     --- the tree that works for the local directory
#    $GIT_TREE_FILE_NAME --- the tree that works for the remote repository
#
# This script is designed to run as a daily cronjob on one of the
# comitter's machines and it is assumed that their git setup has
# access to their server password.
