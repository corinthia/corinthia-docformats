IMPORTANT NOTE: This code does not work in it's current form, and exists for
illustrative purposes only. It is an excerpt from the UX Write source code
indented to show how the bindings between Objective C and JavaScript are
implemented, both in terms of calling *in* to JavaScript, and calling *out* of
JavaScript (that is, callback functions).

The files in this directory should be considered temporary. They are here for
the purpose of demonstrating to developers of various bindings how this can be
achieved. It is envisaged that once there is at least one binding that has been
developed purely as part of the Corinthia project, that will serve as the
example for any future bindings, and the Objective-C/Apple-specific files can be
removed.
